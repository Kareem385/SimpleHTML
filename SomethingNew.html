<h1>Hello. This is a quick summary about myself</h1>

<h2>Created by <span>Kareem Culbertson</span></h2>

<p>I currently live in Yonkers, NY. It's an unique place to live. There's really not much to do but there are good people out here. I guess you can say that about most locations but I can only speak of what I know. I used to live in Brooklyn and even though I made most of my friends out there, I am content with being in Yonkers for now. One day, I hope to move somewhere out of Yonkers to a location that has numerous things for people to do.</p>

<p style = "color:#663033">Hopefully, one day I will be able to become a software developer or programmer in the near future. Technology is around us and is involved with everything that we do. With that being said, I'd love to be apart of something that is continuing to grow at a fast pace.</P>
